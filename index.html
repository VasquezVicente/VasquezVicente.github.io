<h1>Vicente Vasquez Laboratory</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website!.My name is Vicente A. Vasquez Velasquez, I am a Ph.D student in the University of Florida.
   The purpose of this website is to host my personal projects in Tropical Forest Restoration, Ecology, Conservation,
   tropical forest dynamics, climate and remote sensing. I decided to code this website from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
   I mainly provide with tutorial to reproduce my analysis code in R, python, and Google earth engine. Full code is available in my GitHub repository.
   I hope you find this website useful and interesting. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.
